## First things first

Once upon a time, there was a programmer that needed to load a YAML configuration file in a NodeJS project. This programmer was very annoyed by the fact that he needed to load that file using a relative path from each file that needed it. In this time of ~~boredom~~ despair, a hero appears to rescue the ~~princess~~ programmer: nnLoader!

Jokes aside, nnLoader is a library that helps you to load static files using a path relative to the package root.

## Installation

The library can be easily installed with a package manager like yarn (`bash&yarn add nnloader`) or npm (`bash&npm i nnloader`).

## How do I use it?

    The library is very easy to use, all you need is to follow three simple fast steps!

1. Install the package.

2. Import the package. You can use commonJS syntax (`js&const nnLoader = require('nnloader');`) or ES6 syntax (`js&import nnLoader from 'nnloader';`).

3. Use one of its functions.
